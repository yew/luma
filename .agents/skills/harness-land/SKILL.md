# Harness Land

## Authority

Use this skill only after the human explicitly approves merge and `harness
status` reports `execution/finalize/await_merge`. If the candidate is no longer
valid, reopen it and return to `harness-execute` instead of merging.

## Land

1. Verify the recorded PR, current CI, sync, and mergeability facts.
2. Merge using the repository's preferred strategy unless the human specifies
   another.
3. Immediately record merge confirmation, before local branch cleanup or
   checkout changes. Squash, rebase, and merge-commit strategies selected by
   the repository are all valid:

   ```bash
   harness land --pr <url> [--commit <sha>]
   ```

4. Rely on the forge's merge record by default. Add a PR comment or issue update
   only when unresolved or partial work, deployment or release results, or
   material post-merge context needs a durable handoff. Close fully resolved
   issues when that is semantically correct and the forge has not already done
   so; leave explicit pointers for partial or deferred work.
5. Finish local branch cleanup and sync.
6. Run `harness land complete` only after required bookkeeping is done. Confirm
   `harness status` returns to `idle` with landed context preserved.

Do not merge without explicit approval, edit the archived plan to add merge
metadata, manufacture a no-information land comment, silently close partial
issues, or complete land before its durable bookkeeping is finished.
